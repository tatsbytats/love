				I hope you are doing well and reading this. I respect your need for privacy and am aware that you might not wish to speak at this time. I'm still here for you whenever you want to talk or spend time together, so please know that my love for you hasn't changed. In the meantime, I want you to know that you're never far from my mind and that I miss you more than words can say.
